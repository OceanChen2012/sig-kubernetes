## Introduction

Hello everyone, this time I bring you Kubernetes source code reading.

The source code design drawing needs to be used in conjunction with the source code. In addition to showing the key design, the omission of some implementation details will allow you to ask questions as you read. If you find that there are problems when you read the diagram, you can look at the source code with the problem and see how others design and solve it, which will improve your design ability.

If you find that the picture is blurred, it is caused by the picture compression, right click and save it as the original download image or contact me \(WeChat: abser9216\) to send the original SVG image.
